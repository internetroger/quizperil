Trivia Against The Clock!

## Communication/Action Plan

- Group session to build database and rails backend
- Readme on master branch as single source of truth
- Use slack as asynchronous communication during weekend/off hours
- Rule set on repo to require 2 members to view pull request before merging to master

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to login via username
- Select a time interval for quiz
- Take quiz as fast as possible
- Get visual feedback immediately upon answering (indicate correct answer?)
- View running timer (use visual feedback to add urgency)
- View results with metrics
- Choose quiz by category (stretch)
- Bonus for a good score (<80%?)
- Snarky feedback for poor scores?
